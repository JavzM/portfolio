## About Me
I’m **Javier Martínez Blanco**, a **software engineer** who’s been passionate about computers for as long as I can remember. That curiosity is what got me into programming, and it’s still what drives me to
keep learning and building new things.

Lately, I’ve been focusing mostly on **web development**,
but I enjoy exploring other areas of programming as well. Outside of
code, I love tinkering with **hardware** — from PC building to
repurposing old machines. I’ve been getting into
**homelabbing** recently and I’m planning to build my own setup
in the near future. When I’m not in front of a screen, you’ll probably find
me cycling or at the gym.
